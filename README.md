# GPA-Calculator
A GUI that allows a user to enter in their courses that they either have taken, are taking, or are planning on taking. 
They can then enter a target GPA and the system will calculate the GPA they need to get in their current and/or anticipated classes.
The user is required to input the status of the class as well as the number of credit hours.
If the class has a grade, the letter grade can be entered. The user also has the option to enter in the course name.
Each course is displayed in a box with a scorllbar, so the number of courses that can be inputted is theoretically limitless.
Individual courses can be selected in the box and can be removed by clicking a button.
Another button will remove all courses, while another will generate five blank, ungraded three credit courses.
The user can switch to a different page that will display their current GPA. They then have the option to enter in their
target GPA. If the required GPA is greater than a 4.0, the user will be prompted with a message explaining that they need to
take more credit hours to acheive their goal. If the target GPA is less than a 2.0, they will be prompted to take fewer credit
hours, as they are most likely overloading their schedule. If the target GPA is between 2.0 and 4.0, they will be shown the GPA 
they need to obtain in the courses they are currently taking or planning on taking.
